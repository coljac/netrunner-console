use "/" and "?" to quickly search forward
and backwards in the list.

Cancel:               `<ESC>`

Next: Table columns

# Table columns

Press "t" from normal mode to access the
list of available table columns.

When browsing the select list, use "/"
and "?" to quickly search forward and
backwards in the list.

Display selected columns:  `<ENTER>`
Cancel selection:          `<ESC>`

# Searching (1/3)

By default, the search will return the cards that
contain all of the words you enter in either the
name of the card or the card text.

You can use quotation marks to group terms - `"top 3"`
will return different results to `top 3` - the first
returns cards containing the phrase "top 3", the
second all cards containing the words "top" and "3"
in any order.

It's possible to search all of the card fields in
various combinations by using advanced search terms
(similar to *netrunnerdb*). The format `field:value`
will search for cards containing the value in the
specified field, using the full name or abbreviation.
Numeric fields can also be searched using the
operators below.

Remember than any filters set will also apply to
advanced search results.
